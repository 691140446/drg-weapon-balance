# drg-weapon-balance
A list of public mods to balance the base weapons, gear modifications and overclocks in Deep Rock Galactic.

## Content
Every weapon covered will include the following:

### A .pak balance mod
The mods are ready for use and donâ€™t need a mod loader. To use them, just put the pak files in your ```\Steam\steamapps\common\Deep Rock Galactic\FSD\Content\Paks``` folder.

### A .md readme file
This file should list any change made for that weapon, its gear modifications and overclocks.
For each parameter changed, you should list:
* the parameter name
* its default value
* the modded value
* the value offset (decimal)
* the path of the modded file

### A Packer Zipped folder
This folder will include all uncooked files, this is basically the mod in its pre-packed form. It should contain the modded files and the necessary folders only. The goal of this folder is to save time to tweak value when working on the next version of the balance mod.
